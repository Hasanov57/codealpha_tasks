Let's test the hypothesis about Price vs. Category. The table below groups a selection of categories and calculates their average price, clearly showing the trend.

Average Price by Book Category (Selected Examples)

Category	Average Price ($)	Sample Book Count
Science	46.76	5
Philosophy	43.49	                4
History	38.12	10
Fiction	37.45	15
Mystery	35.21	10
Young Adult	33.18	                15
Childrens	29.54	                10
This is a sample for demonstration. A full analysis would include all categories.
