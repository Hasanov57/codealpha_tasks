1. What is the overall distribution of book ratings? Are most books highly rated?

Answer: The ratings are heavily skewed towards the higher end.

A vast majority of books have a rating of 4 or 5.

There are very few books with a rating of 1 or 2.

This could indicate a selection bias (only highly-rated books are listed), review inflation, or that the scale is not used critically.

2. Which book categories (genres) are the most and least expensive on average?

Answer: There is significant price variation between categories.

Most Expensive Categories (Examples): Science, Health, and Philosophy often contain books with higher average prices (often above $45).

Least Expensive Categories (Examples): Humor, Childrens, and Young Adult tend to have lower average prices (often dipping below $30).

This likely reflects the target audience, production costs (e.g., color illustrations vs. plain text), and the perceived market value of the content.

3. Is there a correlation between a book's price and its rating?

Answer: Based on a initial scan, there is no strong, obvious correlation. Expensive books can have low ratings (e.g., "The Electric Pencil" at $56.06 has a 1-star rating) and inexpensive books can have perfect ratings (e.g., "An Abundance of Katherines" at $10.00 has a 5-star rating). A more precise statistical analysis (like calculating a correlation coefficient) would be needed to confirm this definitively.

4. Which categories have the highest and lowest number of books in stock?

Answer: This dataset appears to be a snapshot where every single book is "In stock". Therefore, this question cannot be answered meaningfully from this data. The Stock column shows no variation.

5. What are the most common categories in the dataset?

Answer: The dataset features a wide variety of categories, but some appear more frequently than others.

Common Categories: Fiction, Nonfiction, Young Adult, Fantasy, and Sequential Art (a term for graphic novels/comics) are very well represented.

Less Common Categories: Erotica, Cultural, Academic, Novels (as a distinct category) appear only a handful of times.
